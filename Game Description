Game description

This a level that I made line-by-line in the java programming language.

All sprites were made manually by me somehow in scratch https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/874853342/editor.
Except for the player sprite who was made by my brother https://www.youtube.com/@daniroyalgamer8150.

It is currently under development.

It is a plataformer-like game with 5 levels and 4 endings, beeing them any%, low%, 100% and creative%.

The goal of the game is to pass the 5 levels while collecting gelados (translation for ice cream in portuguese).

It features a level editor, checkpoints, collectables, flags, solid blocks, fake blocks, spikes, unvisible skipes and more!

Checkpoints only work if you get ALL the gelados !!!

More importantly it features a mushroom, that literally does nothing but walk to left and right and despawn when out of view or get smashed by the player!!!

It also features a timer that counts how many hundreds of a secound passed since the first input, that is showed in the "YOU WIN" / "CHEATER" screen

---WARNING---
Requires Java Runtime Edition OR Java Development Kit to work.
But because I'm very nice I'm including the java installer in the game files since 1.16.1
